## Summary
An interesting project based around the concept of, "can we move a metal and harden it on the fly". In this case, I led a team to develop a liquid pump capable of both heating and pushing the Field's metal into our desired application. Field's metal is a eutectic alloy that melts at 62C, as it is eutectic it remains fully hard up until 62C as that is a lower melting point than its composition. The pump we designed was a simple plexiglass container heated with a resistive heating element from a coffee pot, and a peristaltic pump to move the alloy. The project concluded with a working pump, but the greater team that would use the pump changed directions.
