## Summary

The cheapest peristaltic pump available on Amazon, needed modification as was very low quality, challenging to change out tubing for every refreshment, and was generally speaking problematic and prone to failure. Additionally, due to the low volume requirement of the device, the housing for the rollers was tweaked to reduce flow.
