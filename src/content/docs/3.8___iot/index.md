## Summary

Directed and supported electromechanical engineer to develop a simple waterproof test box that enabled communication from a manhole. Long thought to be impossible, we found an antenna and cellular enabled micro-controller configuration that allowed us to communicate from a manhole, from up to 5 ft deep. The tech developed in our mini-testbox was then grafted onto an existing gamma build unit and demonstrated that wireless communication can be enabled from an actual sampling device.
