title: ^Ultra High Speed Pressure Cycler
categories: ['sensata']

## Summary

I developed a system of pressure cycling that would enable me to high speed pressure cycle far in excess of the expected pressure cycling frequencies. Most pressure cycling at Sensata took place <10 Hz, but the cycler I built was capable of cycling at up to 5kHz. Taking a test that could normally take over a year to run and condensing it down to a single day. A customer approached us with a test that would require 400M cycles. Normally this test would take years to run, and so to save millions of dollars in NRE, I developed this cycler.

As an expansion, I was able to run mechanical resonant frequency analysis using the piezo actuator, which enabled Sensata, for the first time, to mechanically characterize the frequency response of a sensor and generate useful data of their true transfer function.
