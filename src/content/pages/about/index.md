A consummate engineer, I have always enthusiastically pursued science and research from a young age. Never one to stop learning, when I'm not working, I devour industry level research on macro trends, hang out with friends, and spend as much time as a I can outdoors. Experienced mechanical focused hardware engineer, with an emphasis on prototyping hardware and leading small teams to develop significant projects.
